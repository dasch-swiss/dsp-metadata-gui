# Before you start

![shortcode window](assets/images/shortcode.png)


Before you start with collecting data to your project in the DSP-metadata-tool **make 
sure you have the alphanumeric shortcode of your project**. You get the shortcode of your project 
from the DaSCH Client Services. The shortcode cannot be changed afterwards, so we prevent you from 
starting without a shortcode. Be sure you have the correct shortcode. Ask the DaSCH Client Services
before entering to get the alphanumeric shortcode provided for your project.
