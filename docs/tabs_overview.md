# Tabbed Windows Overview

All window tabs share some similarities but the "Base Data" tab is slightly
simpler than the other tabs.

## Similarities

All tabs have a frame and a bottom that works alike. There are three buttons 
"Save", "Save and Close", and "Cancel".
The button "Save" allows you to save your entries and carry on on the same 
window, whereas the button "Save and Close" closes the tabbed window after 
saving the data. "Cancel" simply closes the tabbed window without saving data.

All tabs share the same layout: On the left side there is the title of form 
field, right to it there are the fields to enter information.

On the right hand of the window there are buttons with a question mark. If you
click this button a small window opens the "Help" with a brief explanation and an example 
for the field it is attached to.

## Differences

In all tabs but the "Base Tab" there is an additional column to the far right 
with a flag indicating whether the form field is mandatory or optional. If the 
field is empty or formally not filled in correctly the type colour is red in 
case the field is marked as mandatory, or black if flagged as optional.

As soon as the field has been filled in correctly the type colour changes to
green. This applies for mandatory and optional fields.
