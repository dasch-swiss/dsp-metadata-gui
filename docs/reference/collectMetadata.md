# Metadata GUI

___NB:___ _Due to a [bug in python](https://bugs.python.org/issue41515), which causes `mkdocstrings` to crash on `wxPython`, this part of the API documentation needs to be maintained by hand. It's therefor not as thorough as the rest of the API documentation. See the source code for clarifications._

## The GUI Classes

The DSP-Metadata-GUI is managed by a set of classes within the module collectMetadata.py and other
classes. In this page we introduce the GUI classes.

There are the following classes:

- ProjectFrame
- ProjectPanel
- TabOne
- PropertyRow
- DataTab
- HelpPopup
- TabbedWindow
