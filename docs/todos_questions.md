# Prepartory questions or remarks for documentation on GUI level

## List view 

- [ ] At the moment files in the Open Folder dialog are not ingested? Will this 
be changed?


## Tab Base Data

- [X] No questions

## Tab Project

- [ ] Description: Could there be a textfield with multiple lines?
- [ ] End date: Problematic for running projects without end date, if the end date is 
mandatory
- [ ] Publications: I would suggest a field where one can see a complete citation. 
Maybe a text field with multiple lines

## Dataset

- [ ] Abstract: Textfield with multiple lines instead of list box?
- [ ] Language: Could there be a select box?
- [ ] Dataset status: Select box with states: pre start, ongoing, halted, finished 
or others
- [ ] Documentation: Maybe a text field with multiple lines
- [ ] Date modified: Last modification date should be mandatory. People should know if
they work with a outdated data set.

## Person

- [ ] Given name: only the first entered name is visible

## Organization

## Grant
