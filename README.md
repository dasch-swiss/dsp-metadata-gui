# DSP-METADATA-GUI Metadata Module

The dsp-metadata-gui is Python module and provides a GUI for collecting project specific metadata 
and store it in RDF XML.

## Specific objectives of the metadata module

- Collection of metadata on a scientific project for publication on the DSP
- Acquisition of metadata to create an archived project
- The metadata present the project and make it visible to other researchers
- The metadata follow a metadata schema which is explained under
 [dsp-ontologies](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/dsp-ontologies)


# Features

For detailed description see [overview](docs/overview.md)

The metadata module can be used as a tool for recording a research project or for the administration of several projects, for example in an institution. 
A project or a list of projects can be edited. 
Once all mandatory data of a project have been entered, the metadata can be validated. 
If the validation is successful, the project metadata (and files) can be uploaded to the DSP server. 

After approval by the DSP administrator, the project with its metadata (and possibly its project files) is publicly visible and findable.

# Use of the metadata module

1. Select a project folder with the project files it contains (the project folder can be empty, the files can be selected later).

2. Select a project in the list and edit the metadata tabs. The following tabs are available: Base Data, Project, Dataset, Person, Organisation. Filling in the mandatory and possibly the optional fields. A button with a question mark is available behind each field for explanation. Clicking on the question mark makes a help text visible. 

3. Validation

4. Upload to DSP server
