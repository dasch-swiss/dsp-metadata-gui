# Metadata Module

The metadata module provides a GUI for entering project specific metadata and store it in RDF XML.

__TODO:__ Add more information.

The basic idea of collectMetadata.py is the collection of metadata for research projects that 
will be delivered to the DaSCH Service Platform (DSP). The program offers a interface to ingest 
a project, collect metadata and produce an XML-File that can be delivered to the DSP-Servers.

On the top-level these metadata comprise information about the folder in which the 
project files are stored, an informal project name and the the data files if there 
are some (e.g. NIE-INE projects)

On the second level there are functional metadata like short code, short name and the official
long name of the project, as well as the ARK URL and a description of the project. 

On the same level there are information about administrative data (the researcher, its role, the
funding of the project, and information about the permissions to use the data and copyrights 
etc.) 
[This comes below: For collecting the second level information there are different forms]

## How to use

__TODO:__ Add more information.

Install collectMetadata.py on your computer (Requirements see below), if you have a research project
you want to deliver to the DaSCH Service Platform. In the file menu choose 'Open Folder' and open 
your project folder. The project will be displayed in the list of projects. Select the project and 
start editing your metadata with the 'Edit' button below the list. 

To be continued, as soon there is more to choose from...
